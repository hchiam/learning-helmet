# Learning Helmet

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

## If you use [`yarn`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn)

```bash
yarn
yarn start
# and then when you're done:
yarn stop
```

## If you use `node`

```bash
npm install
npm start
# and then when you're done:
npm stop
```

## Just want to add auth to, say, your React app?
